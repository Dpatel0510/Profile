            Hi, my name is Dhruvkumar Patel. I have lived in the United States for 20 years moved here when I was 7 years of age. 
            When I first moved her learning, English was exceedingly difficult, but I overcame that and learned the best I can. 
            I got interested in web development when I was in high school when I was taking my classes to become a mechanical engineer. 
            When I went to collage and started taking more classes in web development I got even more into and chose this as something that I want to do for the rest of my life. 
            In 2018 I got an excellent opportunity to attend a 6-month coding bootcamp at Northwestern university where I was able to learn full stack development. 
            Currently I have went back to Oakton Community Collage to obtain my associates in Computer Programming with focus on website development or app development.
